HTML template for drop ship forms

Not much to see here! Just a basic HTML template to utilize a secure form on a custom domain. I'm using this in my current role as a GDPR-compliant way for my clients to obtain employee and client addresses to dropship swag gifts. We have a landing page with information, then each project is located at its unique url for the duration of the campaign. Once the campaign ends, the url redirects to an information page.
